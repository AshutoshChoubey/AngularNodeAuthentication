<!-- The different types of Angular directives are as follows:

Components—directives with a template. This type of directive is the most common directive type.
Attribute directives—directives that change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.
Structural directives—directives that change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. -->

<!-- Many NgModules such as the RouterModule and the FormsModule define their own attribute directives. The most common attribute directives are as follows:

NgClass—adds and removes a set of CSS classes.
NgStyle—adds and removes a set of HTML styles.
NgModel—adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element. -->
